## Medium
Given an undirected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes an edge between vertices u and v. Count the number of connected components in the graph. Two vertices belong to the same connected component if there is a path between them.
Examples :
Input: V = 5, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [2, 1], [3, 4]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Input: V = 7, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [6, 0], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Output: 3Explanation:

Constraints:1 ≤ V ≤ 10^4
